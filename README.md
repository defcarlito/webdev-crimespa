# WebDev St Paul Crime SPA

Starter Code

# For Partners
### Setup
You need to copy the /db folder from homework 3 to the root of this project after you clone the repo. So your this folder and file should exist:
```
/db/stpaul_crime.sqlite3
```
I can't add the db file to the repo because the file is too big, so you need to add it on your own. 

### Running it

To test it, you need to run the following commands in two seperate terminals: 

Run the Vue app:
```
npm run dev
```
Run the node server:
```
node rest_server.mjs
```


Without the the node server running, we can't request anything from our db.
