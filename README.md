# WebDev St Paul Crime SPA

Starter Code

# For Partners

You need to copy the /db folder from homework 3 to the root of this project. So your app should have:
```
/webdev-crimespa/db/stpaul_crime.sqlite3
```
I can't just add it to the repo because the file is too big, so you need to add it on your own.



To test it, you need to run the following commands in two seperate terminals:
Run the Vue app:
```
npm run dev
```
Run the backend server:
```
node rest_server.mjs
```


Otherwise we can't make requests to the backend if it is not running.
